  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.

  # process scale: [200, 300]

  # version :thumb do
  #   process resize_to_fit: [50, 50]

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:

    %w(jpg jpeg gif png pdf mp4 wmv xls xlsx doc docx ppt pptx mov)
  end

  #   /image video\//

  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
